## HOW I THINK ‚öôÔ∏è

For this project, I started thinking about the basic layout and the components. I wanted to do something functional but with a good design. How I don't have so much experience using redux, I used this tutorial to start to build the basic structure https://redux.js.org/advanced/example-reddit-api 

I like and enjoy so much build the UI, so once I had the API working I started to adjust more the styles and think a better solution for the cards post.

After that, I continued adding more small functionality like read post, refresh, close post, close all posts, and time ago.

Once I had all functionality I started with the responsive, at this point I already knew how I want it to look on mobile, so I modify the components and did the design.


## LIBRARIES USED ‚ö°

+ https://fontawesome.com/
+ https://react-bootstrap.github.io/
+ https://github.com/wwayne/react-tooltip
+ https://github.com/headzoo/react-moment


## TIME SPENT ‚è≥

This project took me 5 days, I would have liked to send it before, but at the same time I started with this interview I started in a new project in my actual job and I did not have much free time to do it.


## TO DO OR THINGS TO IMPROVE ‚è≥

+ Pagination: I don't add pagination because for me don't had so much sense with the design and consider that it was not necessary. I have experience implementing pagination, I have done it in many projects and in different languages. I would have liked very much to implement infinite scroll, I think the design and the application combine really good with this functionality

+ Animations: I try to implement libraries like react-transition-group and react-flip-move, also I tried to do manually, but in no case did I achieved a result that convinced me, so I didn't want to waste more time with that.

+ Redux: How I used the tutorial to build the basic structure of redux the actions and reducers was thinking it to receive a category of reddit post. I wanted to finish and send it the app first, and if necessary can restructure that.



## Thank you!
